Python has no shortage of utilities for building artificial neural networks
(ANNs). [Keras](http://keras.io) is a library for building ANNs that sits atop
of Theano or TensorFlow. I recently tried it out when building a submission for
Kaggle's [Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation
competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation) and found
it to be a pleasure to work with. I find it strikes a nice balance &mdash;
allowing you to focus on the network architecture and avoid getting bogged down
in the implementation details. However you can still get your hands dirty if
you need to.

I've put together a notebook that uses Keras to implement the same ANN I coded
from scratch in a [previous notebook](/notebooks/Artificial-Neural-Network).
As usual, if you want to follow along or play with the code yourself you can
find the notebook in my [ml-python repo](http://github.com/jonchar/ml-python).
