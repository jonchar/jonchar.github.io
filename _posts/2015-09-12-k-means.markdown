The latest addition to my [ml-python](https://github.com/jonchar/ml-python)
repository is a [simple implementation](https://jonchar.github.io/k-means)
of the [*k*-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
unsupervised learning algorithm. It is a straightforward implementation
using numpy arrays that we test on some data generated with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#samples-generator).
This algorithm is a popular and simple way to detect clusters within your
data set, but it is not without it's limitations.
I'll explore that in another post to come!
