The latest addition in my quest to implement common machine
learning algorithms in python is a simple implementation of the [*k*-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
unsupervised learning algorithm. It is a straightforward implementation
using numpy arrays that we test on some data generated with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#samples-generator).
This algorithm is a popular and simple way to detect clusters within your
data set, but it is not without it's limitations.
I'll explore that in another post to come!

As usual, you can find the jupyter notebook in my [ml-python repo](https://github.com/jonchar/ml-python)
if you'd like to follow along, or rendered in HTML here:
