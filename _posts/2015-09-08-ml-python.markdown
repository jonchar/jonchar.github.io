After taking Andrew Ng's machine learning course through Coursera, I've decided
to try implementing some of the learning algorithms using python. The course
focuses on using GNU Octave / MATLAB as these languages are built to make
matrix operations a breeze. I think implmenting learning algorithms in python
will be good practice to help the concepts sink in. I'll be writing up each
algorithm along with the associated theory and an example in IPython
notebooks in my [ml-python](https://github.com/jonchar/ml-python) repo.

I've already implemented [Linear Regression](https://jonchar.github.io/Linear-Regression)
and [Logistic Regression](https://jonchar.github.io/Logistic-Regression)
but have a few more in the works, namely k-means clustering and artificial neural networks. Stay tuned!
